CodeBook.md describes the dataset in use, the variables created to tidy and organize the data, and the code used to perform each step of cleaning and organizing the dataset.

run_analysis.R prepares the data per the course instructions. 

Steps:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the final dataset in text format after all manipulations are complete.
